Act as a senior full-stack programmer.

I would like you to create a javascript-based web that will allow inverting the order of a text string.

Considerations:
- Respect the upper & lowercases of the input text
- Add documentation to the generated code

For instance, if I input 'AI4Devs' it should return 'sveD4IA'.
I already have a template 'index.html' file ready:

"""
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Reverse String</title>
</head>
<body>
<script src="script.js"></script>
</body>
</html>
"""

Requirements:
- I need you to code the content of the associated "script.js" file that will contain the logic to reverse the string
- I need you to change the "index.html" file in order to include:
      - Title: "AI4Devs - Javier Cubelos - Reverse String"
      - An input field to type the input text to reverse
      - A button to submit the text below the input field
      - An empty text box below the button in order to show the reverse string once the button is clicked
